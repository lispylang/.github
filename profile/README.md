  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <blockquote align="center" cite="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/eternal-flame.en.html">
    For God wrote in Lisp code when he filled the leaves with green.
    <br>The fractal flowers and recursive roots: the most lovely hack I've seen.
    <br>And when I ponder snowflakes, never finding two the same,
    <br>I know God likes a language with its own four-letter name.
